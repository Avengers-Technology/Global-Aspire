    title: "METAVERSE: DREAM OR NIGHTMARE OF THE DIGITAL FUTURE?",
    description: "When it comes to Metaverse, many people imagine a fantasy world where all limits of space and time are erased. But is it a beautiful technological dream, or a potential nightmare in the era of total digitalization? This article will help you have a more comprehensive view of Metaverse - a trend that is reshaping the way people live, work and connect. Metaverse is a virtual space built with virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, where people can interact through digital representatives called avatars. This is a parallel universe - a vast digital world where activities such as studying, working, shopping, entertainment... can all take place. The term Metavers is not new, it originated from Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash, but only really became popular after Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021, marking a strong shift towards the virtual future.",

    title: "HOW WILL AI CHANGE THE WORLD IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS?",
    description: "In the past few years, Generative AI has exploded like a technological tsunami, from content creation tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL·E to programming, design systems, and even music creation. However, everything is just the beginning. In the next 5 years, Generative AI will not only be a tool but also become an essential part of all areas of social, economic, and cultural life. So specifically, how will Generative AI change the world? Let's explore. Just a few years ago, writing a movie script, an SEO-standard article, or designing an advertising banner required a team of creative people. But in the near future, Generative AI will become an indispensable partner for creative people. Tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or Claude can support editing, blogging, and creating video scripts quickly. Meanwhile, platforms like Midjourney or DALL·E can create images, posters, and comics in just a few minutes. Instead of replacing humans, generative AI will act as a “virtual colleague” to help shorten the content production process, saving significant costs and time.",

    title: "5 OUTSTANDING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS THAT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD",
    description: "In the digital age, technology not only changes the way we live but also reshapes the entire economy, society and human thinking. Technological breakthroughs in the next few years are not simply improvements, but real revolutions that can change the world. Below are 5 prominent technology trends that are and will have a profound impact on all aspects of life - from business, healthcare, education to the environment and social culture. Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer new, but general AI (AGI) is the breakthrough trend that is attracting the attention of the whole world. If current AI is capable of solving specific tasks such as image recognition, translation, or content writing, AGI can think, learn and act like humans, even smarter. Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and many other technology corporations are investing billions of dollars in developing AGI. As AGI becomes widespread, it will change the way we work, learn, conduct scientific research, and even govern society. However, with its potential comes risks such as loss of control, technological ethics, and impacts on global employment.",

    title: "WHEN ROBOTS REPLACE HUMANS: THE FUTURE OF WORK IN THE TECHNOLOGY ERA",
    description: "In recent decades, the rapid development of technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, is changing the way we live, learn and work. The question Will robots replace humans at work is no longer far-fetched but is gradually becoming a reality. So in the digital age, where will the future of work go? Will humans be pushed aside or find new opportunities in the changing world? From factory assembly lines to virtual assistants in offices, robots are gradually replacing humans in many fields. According to a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), by 2025, machines will take on more than 50% of current workloads. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, retail, accounting, etc. are the most strongly impacted. Robots do not get tired, do not take vacations, work 24/7 and have high precision. In manufacturing environments, robots help increase productivity, reduce errors, and optimize costs. In the service sector, chatbots can provide instant customer support with greater speed and efficiency than humans. However, that raises concerns: if robots replace humans too quickly, millions of workers will lose their jobs. What happens when a large part of the population no longer fits the requirements of the new labor market?",

    title: "DEEPFAKE: HOW TO DISTINGUISH REAL FROM FAKE IN THE AI ERA?",
    description: "In the modern digital age, rapidly developing technology brings many conveniences but also brings serious threats – one of which is deepfake. If you have ever watched a video of a celebrity saying something strange or a fake photo that has gone viral on social media, it is very likely that you have encountered deepfake without even knowing it. So what is deepfake? How to recognize and prevent it before it is exploited? This article will help you understand the nature of deepfake and provide effective ways to distinguish between real and fake in the age of artificial intelligence. Deepfake is a combination of deep learning and fake. This is a technology that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create fake images, sounds or videos that at first glance – or sound – can be so real that it is difficult to distinguish. This technology often uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – where two AI systems compete against each other: one side generates fake content, the other side tries to detect it. Over time, the generated content becomes more and more sophisticated.",

    title: "TECHNOLOGY'S INVASION OF PRIVACY: WHAT CAN WE DO?",
    description: "In the digital age, personal data is becoming the new “black gold”. Large technology corporations such as Google, Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft… are considered “giants” that control not only the platform, but also our digital life. But what is behind that convenience? There are silent data collection, unwanted surveillance, and even sophisticated invasions of personal privacy. So what can we do to protect ourselves? Digital privacy is the ability to control personal information when participating in the online space. This includes location data, browsing behavior, search history, contacts, personal photos, and even phone usage habits. Apple has been criticized for storing sensitive photos on iCloud without clearly notifying users. Although Apple always emphasizes privacy protection policies, security vulnerabilities have caused private photos of many celebrities to be leaked. The Windows 10 operating system collects a lot of data about users, from browsing history, used applications to work habits. Although there is an opt-out option, most users are not clearly instructed to turn this feature off.",
